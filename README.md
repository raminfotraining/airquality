## Airquality
As a smart city student, I would like to keep informed about air quality near the schools at school time and educate our parents, not to keep running car engine while dropping us to school. 

This project will be a short and iterative cycle for developing a working prototype of an app along with a few technologies. My preference for the stack is simple, and I am open for any ideas. 

I like to work with the following tech-stacks:

* .Net Core 3.1 (Backend, API, IoT server, DDD, BDD or TDD)
* Ionic framework (Front End)
* Firebase (No SQL Storage)
* OAuth (Sign up and Login)
* Geolocation (Ionic Cordova)
* Raspberry PI (Sensor and other IoT)
* Design Implementation 
* Documentation
* Dashboard
